\section{Initialization and Reference Alignment}

Accurate initialization of the filter state is essential for rapid convergence
and numerical stability.  The procedure aligns the quaternion, biases, and
latent acceleration with physically observable quantities from the
accelerometer and magnetometer before dynamic updates commence.

\subsection{Attitude Initialization from Accelerometer}

At rest, the accelerometer measures the apparent specific force
\(
\mathbf{f}_b \approx -\mathbf{R}_{wb}\,\mathbf{g}_w,
\)
where $\mathbf{g}_w = [0,\,0,\,g]^\top$ is the gravity vector in world
coordinates.  The normalized accelerometer output
\[
\hat{\mathbf{f}}_b
= \frac{\mathbf{f}_b}{\|\mathbf{f}_b\|}
\]
defines the direction of gravity in the body frame.
The initial world-to-body quaternion $q_0$ is chosen such that
\[
\mathbf{R}(q_0)^\top\,\hat{\mathbf{f}}_b = -\mathbf{e}_z,
\]
that is, the body $z$-axis is aligned with the measured gravity vector.
This provides the initial roll and pitch angles, while yaw remains
undetermined until magnetometer data are available.
If the initial condition is not strictly static, an averaged
low-pass filtered accelerometer reading is used to suppress transient
dynamic components.

\subsection{Yaw Initialization from Magnetometer}

The magnetometer provides a heading reference by observing the local
magnetic field~$\mathbf{B}_w$ expressed in world coordinates.
Given the measured field $\mathbf{m}_b$ in the body frame and the
known inclination~$I$ and declination~$D$, the horizontal projection is
\[
\mathbf{m}_{b,xy} =
\begin{bmatrix} m_x \\[2pt] m_y \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
\psi = \mathrm{atan2}(-m_y,\,m_x) - D.
\]
The initial quaternion is then completed by a rotation about the world
$z$-axis through angle~$\psi$, appended to the tilt-corrected orientation:
\[
q_0 \leftarrow q_{\mathrm{acc}} \otimes q_z(\psi).
\]
This establishes full three-axis attitude alignment consistent with
local magnetic north.

\subsection{Bias and Latent State Initialization}

Gyroscope and accelerometer biases are initialized from pre-sampling averages:
\[
\mathbf{b}_{g0} = \mathrm{mean}(\boldsymbol{\omega}_b), \qquad
\mathbf{b}_{a0} = \mathrm{mean}(\mathbf{f}_b) + \mathbf{R}(q_0)\,\mathbf{g}_w.
\]
The latent OU acceleration $\mathbf{a}_{w0}$ is set to zero or to the
gravity-compensated average of recent acceleration samples, providing a
smooth start for the translational chain:
\[
\mathbf{a}_{w0} = \mathbf{R}(q_0)^\top
  \bigl(\mathrm{mean}(\mathbf{f}_b) - \mathbf{b}_{a0}\bigr) + \mathbf{g}_w.
\]
All linear states $(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{p},\mathbf{S})$ are initialized to
zero unless prior motion information is available.

\subsection{Covariance Initialization}

The initial covariance~$P_0$ is block-diagonal, reflecting independent
uncertainties in attitude, biases, and linear motion:
\[
P_0 =
\mathrm{diag}
(\Sigma_{\theta0},\,
 \Sigma_{b_g0},\,
 \Sigma_{v0},\,
 \Sigma_{p0},\,
 \Sigma_{S0},\,
 \Sigma_{a_w0},\,
 \Sigma_{b_a0}).
\]
Typical values for $\Sigma_{\theta0}$ correspond to several degrees of
tilt uncertainty, while $\Sigma_{a_w0}$ is set to the stationary variance
of the OU process $\sigma_{a_w}^2$.
This initialization ensures positive definiteness of~$P_0$ and allows
the filter to transition smoothly from the stationary prior to fully
dynamic operation.

\subsection{Alignment Verification and Warm-Up}

During the first few seconds of operation, a warm-up phase validates the
attitude alignment by monitoring the magnitude of the accelerometer residual.
If the residual remains within tolerance, magnetic updates are enabled and
the filter transitions to full fusion.  This staged activation prevents
spurious yaw correction during initial transients and establishes a stable
baseline for subsequent online adaptation.
