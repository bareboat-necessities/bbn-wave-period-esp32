  abstract = {In this paper we consider the new estimation algorithm of the measured sinusoidal signal frequency. Unlike most of known similar methods, the proposed algorithm provides the opportunity of partial rejection of unaccounted disturbances presenting in the channel of useful signal measurement. The latter in its turn allows obtaining more accurate estimation of unknown frequency of the measured sinusoidal signal.}
